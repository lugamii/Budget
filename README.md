# BudgetPractice

Simple practice core for Spigot 1.8.8

## Context

Last year, I was a massive Skript fan/user, and I didn't code a SINGLE line of Java (until late april/may).</br>
I then created a simple practice core named BudgetPractice using Skript, and it barely worked.</br>
And eventually, I gave up and moved on from Skript.</br>
But now, as of 15/06/24, I decided to try making it on Java, and seeing if this actually turns up nice or something like that.

## QnA

## Q: Do you plan on constantly trying to update this?
### A: No. This will be a project for me to code stuff when I'm bored, so don't expect updates.

## Q: Can I use *X* feature from Budget on my plugin?
### A: Yes. As long as you leave some credits, I'm fine with that.

## Q: *X* bug is happening, do you plan on fixing it?
### A: Like I said, I don't plan on constantly updating this. But once in a while, I might, so maybe I'll fix it.

## Requirements

- So far, you only need Spigot 1.8.8, but in the future, Budget might need more plugins as dependencies.
